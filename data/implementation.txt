Actually creating a blockchain app is pretty hard and most of the time not very useful unless you are creating a completely new coin. However, if you really want to try it out, I would recommend you to use some already existing libraries. Truffle suite is really the only one that I found that was somewhat understandable, but there are many more out there. Truffle suite is a development environment for decentralized applications (dapps are apps that interact with the blockchain). They have clean and concise documentation for creating contracts, working with APIs, and testing/deploying projects. Ethereum also provides amazing resources for working and creating your own code that will work on the blockchain, however working with Ethereum is very difficult since it is expensive and slow to make any sort of change on the blockchain. Coding your own blockchain is not very difficult, but creating an actually useful and original blockchain that is decentralized is very difficult and I have no idea where to even start. I found some resources that may help, so if you are really interested, you can check them out.
